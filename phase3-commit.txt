feat: Phase 3 - Advanced Weekly Tracking with Health Impact Stories

Sophisticated nutrition intelligence system with research-backed insights:

New Services:
1. nutritionDatabase.ts (600+ lines)
   - 50+ nutrient-dense foods with complete profiles
   - USDA FoodData Central sourced (validated)
   - Bioavailability factors for accurate absorption modeling
   - Preparation tips and health benefits per food
   - Glycemic index, allergen info, cost levels

2. weeklyDeficitTracker.ts (300+ lines)
   - 7-day cumulative deficit analysis
   - Health risk scoring algorithm (0-100 scale)
   - Severity classification: chronic/frequent/occasional
   - Daily alerts: "You missed X yesterday AND 5/7 days this week"
   - Recovery timeline estimation with confidence intervals

Key Features:
- Health Impact Stories: Real-world scenarios with science explanations
- Visual metaphors for animations (e.g., "rusty gears → smooth machine")
- Immediate symptoms + long-term risks per nutrient
- Action steps with specific portions and timings
- Success stories with measurable outcomes

Complex Algorithms:
- Weighted deficit coverage scoring (severity × bioavailability × portion)
- Nutrient density calculations (nutrients per calorie)
- Multi-objective optimization for recommendations
- Temporal pattern analysis (consecutive days deficient)
- Adaptive recovery timeline based on deficit severity

Research-Backed Content:
